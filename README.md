Description
===========

Clanstats is used to merge different players into a viewable statisic
overview for [Battlefield 3](http://www.battlefield.com). It is
simple to install and easy to use.

You can find the official homepage here: http://www.grewe.ca/projects/php/clanstats/

Requirements
============

* Either enable disk cache or use Memcache if available (recommended)
* BF3stats.com API Keys if you wish to run the player update cronjob
* PHP CURL Library

Installation
============

* Upload the bf3stats source code folder to your Website
* Ensure `templates/compile` and `templates/cache` are writable by the server
* Configure your players in `include/config/global.inc.php`
* Enable (if available) or Disable the Memcache inÂ `include/config/global.inc.php`

Configuration
=============

It comes pre-configured with some players so once uploaded and changing
permissions you should already see some statistics.

You can find a sample configuration with comments here: [include/config/global.inc.php](include/config/global.inc.php)
