Description
===========

Clanstats is used to merge different players into a viewable statisic
overview for [Battlefield 3](http://www.battlefield.com). It is
simple to install and easy to use.

Installation
============

Simply download the code and install on your webserver, then ensure that
some directories are writable by the webserver:

* `templates/cache`
* `templates/compile`

It comes pre-configured with some players so once uploaded and changing
permissions you should already see some statistics.

Configuration
=============

The source comes with a sample configuration and comments: [include/config/global.inc.php](include/config/global.inc.php)
